    Overall, the plots is nicely done. 
    Clarity: This heatmap plot is easy to follow. The color scheme is distinct with a clear legend. The 'reds' heatmap color scheme though, could also be a choice. The intensive and dark red might put more emphasis on those month when the 311 calls happend most. The x-labels and y-labels are well-labeled. 
    Aethetics: There isn't much distortion of data as I examined the code. I agree that the heatmap is one of the most appropriate plots to present this kind of data. 
    HONESTY: The plots honestly reproduced the data and didn't introduce an bias.
