## Graph:

    1. This is a bar chart that visualizes the general data nice and clear.

    1. By comparing the first with the second graph, I found that the color scheme didn't change. However, the 'blue' color now represents different things. Is it better to use another color for the new category 'deli/grocery' to avoid possible ambiguity?

    1. The transparency of the scatter plot can be increased to 1 and maybe the dots can be larger.
    2. There might be a discrepancy between the title and the plot. The availability of delis/groceries is probably talking about the number of delis/groceries businesses per 100 (or something) all businesses, instead of a ratio between them or percentage receiving the assistance.

    1. As the lecture suggests, it would be better to have the x-labels and y-labels of longitude and latitude and degrees unit. 


    Overall, all the plots are nicely done. 
    Clarity: I found that all of the plots are easy to read. The color scheme is distinct. The choice of blue, green, and light pink can well be distinguished from each other in a bar graph. The x-labels and y-labels are well-constructed, especially in the second plot, where the numerous x-labels are well separated from each other which made them readable. All axis have labels as well, except 'number of businesses' which is kind of inapplicable. 
    Aethetics: All of those look nice except a few glitches which I detailed under certain plot above. There isn't much distortion of data as I examined the code. 
    HONESTY: The plots honestly reproduced the data and didn't emphasize a point or trend.
    * I found that the sequence of plots are different between those in the ipython notebook and those in readme. Thus, I used the sequence according to the one in readme.md
