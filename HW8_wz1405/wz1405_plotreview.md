## Wenjie Zheng's Plot
![](https://github.com/sg5718/PUI2018_wz1405/blob/master/HW8_wz1405/Figure1.png)

##### Caption: 
This is a map of New York City with choropleth colored map with no significant border edges which divide the borders between vicinities. The areas on the map show the broadband internet access coverage. The lighter the color is, the percentage of Broadband Internet per 100 people is better and the darker the color is the Broadband Internet coverage percentage per 100 people is worse. The points on the map show the locations of linkNYC devices. The lighter the color is, the earlier the date it is set up; while the darker the color gets, the later the date the device is set up. We are able to see for most cases, the LinkNYC devices are in the area with less-accessible broadband internet connection to address the problem, such as the Flatbush Ave corridor in Brooklyn, the Queens Blvd corridor in Queens, and along the Second Avenue in the Upper East in Manhattan, etc. 

##### Review: 
- Clarity: The plot is easy to read. However, the lack of legends makes the quantities being visualized ambiguous at the first glimpse without reading the caption.
- Esthetic: Overall, the plot does well. The colors are chosen appropriately. The graphical elements are used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized. The graphical choices are allowing me to focus on the right elements. However, the font size of title is too small and easily ignored.
- Honesty: In general, the plot is honestly reproducing the data.
- Suggestions:
  - Add legends into the plot, like we did in HW 7.
  - Change the font size of the title to make it more noticeable.
