# wz1405 Plot Review

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wz1405/PUI2018_wz1405/master/HW8_wz1405/Figure1.png)

The plot shows broadband internet access coverage and Link NYC station in New York City. It's difficult to see the meaning behind the colors without looking at the caption since there is no legend. However, from the map, we can see that locations of link NYC stations are positioned within area with higher coverage of internet in case of Brooklyn and Queens area. It could be better if there is a reference to what the area represents (neighborhood?).
