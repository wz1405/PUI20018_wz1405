## ASSIGNMENTS:

### Submission Info:

Readme.md
Assignment 1:
I worked on that alone. 
Assignment 2:
Haoming Yang, Jianwei Li, and I worked on this assignment together. 

Assignment 3 & 4:
I worked on these mainly but Junjie Cai offered me some help.



## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests as well as for the Readme.md

Work with one, or maximum two people. 

Choose three tests from the table in the slides 

![stats test](statsTable.png)

one in the top potrion of the chart (chi-sq, t-test, and the ANOVA family of tests) where you are looking for differences between groups, and one in the bottom portion where you are looking for relationships bewteen the dependent and independent variables (correlation, regression, path analysis), and a logistic regression.

Go to the main web page of the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/) and search for articles that use that test (**DO NOT USE THE ARTICLE I USED FOR THE CLASS EXAMPLE:** http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062593).

Put the name of your tests (one by one) in the search (you can also use the advanced search) and choose a paper that uses the test you selected. Read the relevant portions of the paper (the abstract, and then a search for occurrences of the test name may be sufficient!) and identify what are the Dependent Variables (DV), Independent Variables (IV), and, if applicable, control variables (remember class 2 slides if you forgot), how many they are, and what type they are (categorical, continuous...). 

Write out the number of DV, type of DV, number of IV, type of IV, number of control variables, kind of questions as a [table](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables) in your README.md file, filling in the same fields as in the first table in the literature about ["When to use what test?"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116565/). 

This is a template for the table. To see how it is written clock on the Raw link to see this README.md in its raw unrendered format.

### GRADING: 

Your HW6\_\<netID\> README.md should show, in addition to the usual items (the scope of the homework, the group partecipants, your role in the group work) a two-row tables like the one above explaining the use of two tests in papers published in PLOS One.
